       "'Image copyright Getty ImagesOn Sunday morning Donald Trump went off on a Twitter tirade against a member of his own partyThis in itself isnt exactly huge news Its far from the first time the president has turned his rhetorical cannons on his own ranksThis time however his attacks were particularly biting and personal He essentially called Tennessee Senator Bob Corker the chair of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee a coward for not running for reelectionHe said Mr Corker begged for the presidents endorsement which he refused to give He wrongly claimed that Mr Corkers support of the Iranian nuclear agreement was his only political accomplishmentUnlike some of his colleagues Mr Corker  free from having to worry about his immediate political future  didnt hold his tongueSkip Twitter post by SenBobCorker Its a shame the White House has become an adult day care center Someone obviously missed their shift this morning  Senator Bob Corker SenBobCorker October 8 2017 ReportThat wasnt the end of it though He then spoke with the New York Times and really let the president have it Here are four choice quotes from the Tennessee senators interview with the Times and why they are particularly damningI dont know why the president tweets out things that are not true You know he does it everyone knows he does it but he doesYou cant really sugarcoat this one Mr Corker is flatout saying the president is a liar  and everyone knows itThe senator in particular is challenging Mr Trumps insistence that he unsuccessfully pleaded for his endorsement but the accusation is much broaderMr Corker and the president used to be something akin to allies The Tennessean was on Mr Trumps short list for vicepresident and secretary of stateImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Bob Corker at Trump campaign rally in July 2016Those days are seemingly very much over now  and its not like Mr Corker is going anywhere anytime soon Although hes not running for reelection hell be in the Senate chairing a powerful committee until January 2019The presidents margin for success in that chamber is razorthin If Democrats can continue to stand together in opposition he can afford to lose only two votes out of 52 Republican senators Thats why healthcare reform collapsed in July  and it could be bad news for tax effortsFrom here on out Mr Corker isnt going to do the president any favoursLook except for a few people the vast majority of our caucus understands what were dealing with hereFrustration in Congress has been growing over what Republicans feel has been the presidents inability to focus on advancing their agenda Getting a sharply divided party to come together on plans to repeal Obamacare reform taxes or boost infrastructure spending is challenging enough Doing so when the president stirs up unrelated controversies on a seemingly daily basis makes things all the harderOne of the presidents gifts has been his ability to shake off negative stories by quickly moving on to a different subject That worked brilliantly during his presidential campaign but its less effective during the legislative slow grindImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Corker at the confirmation hearing for Secretary of State Rex TillersonFor months Republicans in Congress have been grumbling about this in the background and among themselves Occasionally someone like Mr McConnell will lament that the president doesnt understand how the Senate worksMr Corker has now stated it loud and clear And whats more he says almost everyone agrees with him Theyve kept silent until now because they still hope to pass conservative legislation that the president can sign or fear Mr Trumps legions will back a primary challenge next year or stay home during the general electionIf that calculus ever changes  if it becomes riskier to stay silent than speak out  Mr Trump will be in real troubleA lot of people think that there is some kind of good cop bad cop act underway but thats just not trueTime and again Mr Trump has appeared to undercut Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and others in his administration who are attempting to use soft diplomacy to deal with a range of international crisesThe war against the Taliban in Afghanistan Irans compliance with the multinational nuclear agreement the ongoing dispute between Qatar and its Persian Gulf neighbours the unrest in Venezuela and most recently North Koreas continued ballistic missile tests have all been the target of the presidents offhand remarks and Twitter invectiveSome administration defenders have said this is all a part of Mr Trumps strategy  an updated version of the Nixonera madman theory in which the president forces adversaries to give way because they fear an unpredictable US leaders actionsMr Corker isnt buying it Theres no strategy he says just the possibility of chaos  which he hopes Mr Trumps senior advisers will be able to avoidI know for a fact that every single day at the White House its a situation of trying to contain himTheres now a growing collection of John Kelly facepalm photos that serve as a testament to the chiefofstaffs reported frustration at dealing with the presidentMr Trump goes offscript to praise torchbearing white nationalists at a rally in Charlottesville and Mr Kelly is captured closing his eyes and rubbing the arch of his nose as if attempting to stave off a migraineImage copyright Reuters Image caption White House Chief of Staff John Kelly looks on as US President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rallyThe president calls North Korean leaders criminals in a speech to the United Nations and Mr Kelly straightup buries his face in his handsThe White House communications team is often left scrambling to try to explain or reframe an indelicate presidential joke or remark that directly contradicts what was until then the official administration lineEven though Mr Kelly has brought some discipline to the West Wing staff the president still marches to the beat of his own drum  and continues to have unfettered access to his phones Twitter appBob Corker is only the latest person  politician journalist sports star or celebrity  to feel the mercurial presidents uncontainable ire'"
